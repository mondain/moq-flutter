              Applying Per-Session Limits for WebTransport
                draft-thomson-webtrans-session-limit-01

Abstract

   Limits to how a WebTransport session uses QUIC resources like streams
   or data can help reduce the effect that one WebTransport session has
   on other uses of the same HTTP/3 connection.  This describes
   mechanisms for limiting the number of streams and quantity of data
   that can be consumed by each WebTransport session.

1.  Introduction

   WebTransport in HTTP/3 [WTH3] provides applications with all the
   functionality of QUIC [QUIC] streams.  In the case where a single
   connection includes a WebTransport session that needs to coexist with
   other WebTransport sessions or HTTP requests, the core draft does not
   offer any way to place limits on stream usage.

   This document describes an additional layer of session-level flow
   control that governs the creation of streams and sets a session-level
   limit on the amount of data that can be exchanged in a session.

   This document does not define a framework for prioritizing the
   streams created for a WebTransport session with other streams.

   Note that this document is intended as input for [WTH3].  Although it
   is possible to define this as an extension to that protocol,
   integration of this design is simpler; see Section 4.

2.  Conventions and Definitions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

3.  Protocol Definition

   This document uses the following flow control capsules defined in
   [WTH2]:

   *  WT_MAX_DATA (Section 5.5 of [WTH2])

   *  WT_MAX_STREAMS (Section 5.7 of [WTH2])

   *  WT_DATA_BLOCKED (Section 5.8 of [WTH2])

   *  WT_STREAMS_BLOCKED (Section 5.10 of [WTH2])

   These capsules are unchanged, except that where the WebTransport over
   HTTP/2 capsules refer to streams that flow over the HTTP/2 stream
   containing the entire WebTransport session, these capsules refer to
   separate limits as described in subsequent sections.

   These capsules use the codepoints allocated in [WTH2].

3.1.  Stream Limits

   The WT_MAX_STREAMS capsule establishes a limit on the number of
   streams within a WebTransport session.  Like the QUIC MAX_STREAMS
   frame (Section 19.11 of [QUIC]), this capsule has two types that
   provide separate limits for unidirectional and bidirectional streams
   that are initiated by a peer.

   The session-level stream limit applies in addition to the QUIC
   MAX_STREAMS frame, which provides a connection-level stream limit.
   New streams can only be created within the session if both the
   stream- and the connection-level limit permit; see Section 4.6 of
   [QUIC] for details on how QUIC stream limits are applied.

   Unlike the WT_MAX_STREAMS capsule or the QUIC MAX_STREAMS frame,
   there is no simple relationship between the value in this frame and
   stream IDs in QUIC STREAM frames.  This especially applies if there
   are other users of streams on the connection.

   The WT_STREAMS_BLOCKED capsule is sent to indicate that an endpoint
   was unable to create a stream due to the session-level stream limit.

3.2.  Data Limits

   The WT_MAX_DATA capsule establishes a limit on the amount of data
   that can be sent within a WebTransport session.  This limit counts
   all data that is sent on streams of the corresponding type, excluding
   the stream header (see Sections 4.2 and 4.2 of [WTH3]).  The stream
   header is excluded from this limit so that this limit does not
   prevent the sending of information that is essential in linking new
   streams to a specific WebTransport session.

   Implementing WT_MAX_DATA requires that the QUIC stack provide the
   WebTransport implementation with information about the final size of
   streams; see Section 4.5 of [QUIC].

   The WT_DATA_BLOCKED capsule is sent to indicate that an endpoint was
   unable to send data due to a limit set by the WT_MAX_DATA capsule.

   Because WebTransport over HTTP/3 uses a native QUIC stream for each
   WebTransport stream, per-stream data limits are provided by QUIC
   natively.  The WT_MAX_STREAM_DATA and WT_STREAM_DATA_BLOCKED capsules
   are not used and so are prohibited.  Endpoints MUST treat receipt of
   a WT_MAX_STREAM_DATA or a WT_STREAM_DATA_BLOCKED capsule as a session
   error.

4.  Negotiation

   If the use of flow control capsules are merged into the main
   specification [WTH3], their use will be negotiated along with the use
   of WebTransport over HTTP/3.  This is the simplest approach.

   Alternatively, if this remains as an optional extension, new HTTP/3
   settings will be needed to negotiate the use of these features.  In
   the abstract, we could define settings that carry initial values for
   the three variables that are controlled by the session-level flow
   control capsules defined here.  The presence of any of those settings
   would indicate that these limits will be respected if the capsule is
   sent.

   Both peers need to indicate the setting before these capsules apply.
   If only one peer advertises any of these settings, that might
   indicate that they are willing to receive and respect session-level
   flow control capsules.  However, such an endpoint cannot know when to
   start applying the limit.

5.  Security Considerations

   Aside from new exposure to the usual programming errors arising from
   increased protocol complexity, it is believed that the introduction
   of these capabilities only improves security as it provides better
   control over endpoint resource allocation.

6.  IANA Considerations

   This document has no IANA actions.
