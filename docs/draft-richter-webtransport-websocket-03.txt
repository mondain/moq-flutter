                      WebTransport over WebSocket
                draft-richter-webtransport-websocket-03

Abstract

   WebTransport [OVERVIEW], a protocol framework within the Web security
   model, empowers Web clients to initiate secure multiplexed transport
   for low-level client-server interactions with remote servers.  This
   document outlines a protocol, based on WebSocket [WEBSOCKET],
   offering WebTransport capabilities similar to the HTTP/2 variant
   [WEBTRANSPORT-H2].  It serves as an alternative when UDP-based
   protocols are inaccessible, and the client environment exclusively
   supports WebSocket [WEBSOCKET].

1.  Introduction

   WebTransport [OVERVIEW] is designed to facilitate communication for
   Web clients over HTTP/3 [HTTP3], leveraging QUIC [QUIC] semantics
   with streams or datagrams [DATAGRAM].  In cases where UDP-based
   traffic is restricted, HTTP/2 protocol [WEBTRANSPORT-H2] serves as an
   alternative built solely on HTTP semantics.

   Both [WEBTRANSPORT-H2] and [WEBTRANSPORT-H3] variants require a
   native WebClient implementation due to the usual unavailability of
   plain UDP and TCP/IP socket access for scripts within WebClients

   This document defines a protocol that can be implemented on the
   WebClient using available scripting languages without altering the
   WebClient's native code.  It uses the widespread WebSocket protocol
   as the base without modification.  However, a direct implementation
   in a WebClient is possible.

Internet-Draft               WebTransport-WS                    May 2025


   The protocol utilizes capsule semantics derived from
   [WEBTRANSPORT-H2] and translates them into WebSocket frames.  By
   relying on WebSockets, also intermediates such as proxies unaware of
   WebTransports can apply application-layer processing.

   An implementation should support both WebSocket over http/1 and
   http/2.  The server should incorporate WebTransport flow control
   constraints and capsule processing into its WebSocket parser code.
   Therefore, using unmodified existing WebSocket code is not
   recommended.

2.  Conventions and Definitions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

   The document follows the terminology defined in Section 1.2 of
   [OVERVIEW].

3.  Protocol Overview

   WebTransport servers are identified by an HTTPS URI per Section 4.2.2
   of [HTTP].

   The protocol uses [WEBTRANSPORT-H2] semantics with the following
   modifications.

3.1.  Connection, version negotiation and application level protocol

   The WebSocket connection is established according to Section 4 of
   [WEBSOCKET] or [WEBSOCKET-H2].

   When a WebSocket connection is established, both the client and
   server select the WebTransport-Websocket protocol by setting |Sec-
   WebSocket-Protocol| Section 1.9 of [WEBSOCKET] to the supported
   versions.  The protocol names follow the scheme
   "webtransport_VERSIONNAME" or additionally
   "webtransport_VERSIONNAME_APPLICATIONLEVELPROTOCOL, where VERSIONNAME
   identifies the particular protocol version and
   APPLICATIONLEVELPROTOCOL an application-level protocol.  For this
   protocol version, VERSIONNAME would be "kDraft3" and the |Sec-
   WebSocket-Protocol| field would include "webtransport_kDraft2" or
   additionally "webtransport_kDraft2_application_level_protocol" for an
   application-level protocol "application_level_protocol".  The
   application level protocol is the same available handled via WT-

Internet-Draft               WebTransport-WS                    May 2025


   Available-Protocols and WT-Protocol described in Section 3.4 of
   [WEBTRANSPORT-H2] and Section 3.4 of [WEBTRANSPORT-H3].  The protocol
   negotiation follows the procedures as described in Section 4.1 of
   [WEBSOCKET] and Section 4.2.2 of [WEBSOCKET].  No protocol extensions
   MUST BE negotiated.

3.2.  Data framing

   The protocol uses the data frames as defined in Section 5 of
   [WEBSOCKET].  PING and PONG frame handling is not changed Section 5.5
   of [WEBSOCKET].

   For closing a session, a CLOSE_WEBTRANSPORT_SESSION capsule followed
   by the CLOSE frame Section 5.5.1 of [WEBSOCKET] is sent.

   Data Frames containing Text are reserved for future use and MUST NOT
   be sent.  Binary Data Frames transport CAPSULE content defined in
   [WEBTRANSPORT-H2] and [DATAGRAM].  For details, refer to the next
   section Section 3.3.  Their length is limited by WebTransport flow
   control, and a violation SHOULD lead to connection termination.
   CONTINUATION frames are processed per [WEBSOCKET] specifications.
   Given the streaming nature of the content, partial DATA frames or
   CONTINUATION frames should be promptly forwarded to corresponding
   streams reducing latency.

3.3.  Capsule frames

   This protocol adopts the mechanisms and intrinsic elements outlined
   in [WEBTRANSPORT-H2], which itself is constructed upon the CAPSULE
   protocol originating from [DATAGRAM].

   A CAPSULE has the form in [DATAGRAM]:

   Capsule {
     Capsule Type (i),
     Capsule Length (i),
     Capsule Value (..),
   }

   where Capsule Type and Length are variable-length integers.  The
   Capsule Value represents the payload of the capsule, and its
   semantics are determined by the payload type

   In the context of WebTransport over WebSockets, CAPSULEs are
   substituted by binary DATA FRAMES of WebSockets, following the
   format:

Internet-Draft               WebTransport-WS                    May 2025


   WebSocketDataFrameCapsule {
     FrameHeader (..),
     PayloadData (..)
   }

   FrameHeader contains the first two bytes of the FRAME, and if present
   the extended payload length and masking key as defined in Section 5.2
   of [WEBSOCKET].  PayloadData is defined as:

   PayloadData {
     Capsule Type (i),
     Capsule Value (..)
   }

   with the variable length integer Capsule Type and Capsule Value as in
   the CAPSULE protocol.

   Capsule length can be calculated from the Payload Length as set in
   Section 5.2 of [WEBSOCKET]:

     Capsule Length = Payload Length - sizeof(Capsule Type),

   as no Extension Data is allowed.

3.4.  Replacement for SETTINGS

   Section 3.2 of [WEBTRANSPORT-H2] requires sending an
   SETTINGS_WEBTRANSPORT_MAX_SESSIONS settings parameter.  This is not
   required here, as the protocol type is negotiated using the
   subprotocol mechanism of WebSockets and
   SETTINGS_WEBTRANSPORT_MAX_SESSIONS equal to 1 is assumed per
   WebSocket connection(HTTP1)/stream(HTTP2).  Subsections of
   Section 4.3 of [WEBTRANSPORT-H2] require sending initial SETTINGS for
   flow control.  As SETTINGS are not accessible for the WebSocket
   protocol using the existing WebSocket interfaces, a replacement is
   required.

   Therefore client and server MUST send the initial flow control values
   using CAPSULES immediately before ANY other capsules such as
   WT_STREAM or DATAGRAM capsules have been sent.

4.  Implementation Status

   The protocol is implemented in a node.js package (https://github.com/
   fails-components/webtransport).

5.  Security Considerations

   The security considerations of Section 10 of [WEBSOCKET] also apply
   here.  The last paragraph of Section 8 of [WEBTRANSPORT-H2] is
   equally applicable to this protocol.

6.  IANA Considerations

6.1.  WebSocket Subprotocol Name Registry

   All possible subprotocol names following the format
   "webtransport_VERSION" and "webtransport_VERSION_SUBPROTOCOL," where
   VERSION is an alphanumeric string denoting the subprotocol version of
   this protocol and SUBPROTOCOL can be any application-level string,
   are added to the registry as domains for this protocol and its
   successors.

6.2.  WebTransport WebSocket Protocol Version Registry

   This specification establishes a new IANA registry for WebTransport
   Protocol Version names, intended for use with the WebSocket
   WebTransport Protocol, in alignment with the principles outlined in
   [RFC5226].

   As part of this registry, IANA manages the following information
   (similar to [WEBSOCKET] versions):

   Version String The version string name as part of the subprotocol
   defined in Section 6.1 and Section 3.1.  The value must only include
   alphanumeric characters.

   Reference The RFC requesting a new version number or a draft name
   with version number (see below).

   Status Either "Interim" or "Standard".  See below for a description.

   A version string can be either "Interim" or "Standard".

   A "Standard" version string is part of an RFC and identifies a major,
   stable version of the WebTransport-WebSocket protocol.  The "IETF
   Review" IANA registration policy [RFC5226] applies to "Standard"
   version string.

   An Internet-Draft documents an "Interim" version string.  Internet-
   Drafts helps implementors to identify and interoperate with the
   WebTransport-WebSocket protocol, as this current draft.  The "Expert
   Review" IANA registration policy [RFC5226] applies to the "Interim"
   version names.  The initial Designated Experts need to be determined.
